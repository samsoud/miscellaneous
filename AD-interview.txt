Client requests an authentication ticket (TGT) from the Key Distribution Center (KDC)
The KDC verifies the credentials and sends back an encrypted TGT and session key
The TGT is encrypted using the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) secret key
The client stores the TGT and when it expires the local session manager will request another TGT (this process is transparent to the user)
If the Client is requesting access to a service or other resource on the network, this is the process:
The client sends the current TGT to the TGS with the Service Principal Name (SPN) of the resource the client wants to access
The KDC verifies the TGT of the user and that the user has access to the service
TGS sends a valid session key for the service to the client
Client forwards the session key to the service to prove the user has access, and the service grants access.

SAML:
The user accesses the remote application using a link on an intranet, a bookmark, or similar and the application loads.

The application identifies the user’s origin (by application subdomain, user IP address, or similar) and redirects the user back 
to the identity provider, asking for authentication. This is the authentication request.

The user either has an existing active browser session with the identity provider or establishes one by logging into the identity provider.

The identity provider builds the authentication response in the form of an XML-document containing the user’s username or email address, 
signs it using an X.509 certificate, and posts this information to the service provider.

The service provider, which already knows the identity provider and has a certificate fingerprint, 
retrieves the authentication response and validates it using the certificate fingerprint.

The identity of the user is established and the user is provided with app access.
